# Matlab Code to Simulate Langmuir Circulation

This code was programmed to simulate the homogeneous Langmuir Circulation. It was originally made for fast prototyping to test numerical stability etc. 

The following video is depicting the homogeneous Langmuir circulation. The domain y-z domain is the cross wind domain, with wind blowing into the board. From along wind velocity (x-velocity), upwelling and downwelling jets are formed to generate the vertical mixing and cellular flow as seen from x-vorticity.
