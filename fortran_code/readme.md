# Fortran Code to Simulate Langmuir Circulation

## Vertical Stratification
Langmuir circulation imposed upon vertical stratification is to simulate ocean surface wind driven turbulence interacting with ocean thermocline.

## Horizontal Stratification
Langmuir circulation imposed upon horizontal stratification is to simulate ocean surface wind driven turbulence interacting with ocean fronts maintained by thermal wind balance, or horizontal shear flow.
### Frozen Background
Outside heating and cooling sources are added to the system to maintain the horizontal temperature gradient. Buoyancy driven flow is very likely to happpen once the systerm encounters across wind perturbation. In this case, the horizontal buoyancy driven convection is assisting Langmuir Circulation to form and reconstruct itself to adjust to horizontal stratification.

### Free Background
The horizontal stratification is balanced by horizontal shear flow. The horizontal cross-front shear flow is battling with Langmuir circulation.
#### Stationary Mode
When the cross-front shear flow is weak as a result of weak horizontal stratification, Langmuir cells would be able to baricade the horizontal shear flow, and serve to maintain the horizontal stratification.

#### Traveling Mode
When the cross-front shear flow is strong as a result of strong horizontal stratification, Langmuir cells would be torn apart and subcells are carried down the stream by the cross front shear flow.
